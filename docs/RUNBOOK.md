# Tenure Pilot Runbook

Live URL: https://d1n6mdis7bs02g.cloudfront.net · AWS account `154932391697` (us-east-1)

## Repository layout

This is an npm-workspaces monorepo. The application is the `apps/web` workspace;
`infrastructure/`, `docs/` and `.github/workflows/` stay at the root.

Unqualified paths below (`prisma/schema.prisma`, `scripts/seed.mjs`,
`src/lib/env.ts`, …) are **relative to `apps/web/`**, which is also the
directory the container runs from once `prisma/` and `scripts/` are flattened
into its `/app` workdir. Anything run against the app — prisma, jest,
playwright, next — either runs from `apps/web` or goes through a root
delegating script (`npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run e2e`), never from the
monorepo root directly.

## Onboarding a real institution

1. **Institution + OSE staff.** Adapt `scripts/seed.mjs` (or run the same Prisma calls
   from a one-off script): create the `Institution` (name, slug, email `domain`),
   the OSE users, and their `InstitutionMembership` rows (`OSE_DIRECTOR` / `OSE_STAFF`).
2. **Clubs and seats.** For each club: `Organization` (slug is the URL), then `Role`
   seats — one `PRESIDENT`, functional VP seats, one `MEMBER` role.
3. **People.** Create `User` rows with real university emails and `RoleAssignment`s:
   `ACTIVE` for current holders, `SHADOW` for incoming leaders. Do not backfill
   ALUMNI unless the history matters on day one.
4. **Auth.** Real logins require Okta:
   - Create an Okta OIDC app (redirect URI: `https://<domain>/api/auth/callback/okta`).
   - Put `OKTA_CLIENT_ID`, `OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OKTA_ISSUER` into Secrets Manager
     secret `tenure-pilot/app` (console → edit the JSON keys, they already exist).
   - Set `AUTH_DEV_LOGIN` to `"false"` in `infrastructure/terraform/ecs.tf` and deploy.
     **The demo picker must be off before real data enters the system.**
5. **Domain.** Point a real domain at CloudFront (ACM cert in us-east-1 + alias in
   `cloudfront.tf`), update `NEXTAUTH_URL` in `ecs.tf`.

## Routine operations

| Task | How |
|---|---|
| Deploy | Push to `main` — CI (48 unit + 32 e2e tests) gates, version verified live |
| Diagnose prod | Actions → **Debug Logs** workflow → ECS events + container log heads |
| Rotate auth secret | Actions → **Rotate Auth Secret** workflow (invalidates sessions) |
| DB access | RDS is VPC-only; connect via a bastion or `aws ecs execute-command` |
| Metrics | CloudWatch dashboard `tenure-pilot-ops`; alarms on 5xx, task count, RDS CPU, DLQ |

## Security posture (Week 8 review)

- **AuthN:** NextAuth v5, JWT sessions, `trustHost` behind CloudFront/ALB.
  Pilot dev-login is ON for demos — see step 4 above before real rollout.
- **AuthZ:** every server action re-checks permissions server-side
  (`src/lib/rbac.ts`, `memory.ts`, `messaging.ts`, `approvals.ts`); denials are
  audit-logged and surface on `/reports`.
- **Secrets:** Secrets Manager (app bundle + RDS-managed DB password), injected
  at task start; nothing in the repo. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` via GitHub secret →
  Terraform var.
- **Data:** RDS encrypted, deletion protection + final snapshot on; S3 documents
  SSE-AES256, private, presigned 10-min downloads; append-only `AuditEvent` and
  `ApprovalStep` trails.
- **Transport:** TLS at CloudFront (min TLSv1.2), HSTS + nosniff + frame-deny +
  referrer-policy headers app-wide.
- **AI:** the model receives only content the requesting user can already see;
  answers must cite numbered sources.

## Changing the database schema

Schema changes are versioned. Editing `prisma/schema.prisma` is half the change;
the migration is the other half, and CI fails without it.

```sh
cd apps/web                                       # prisma resolves ./prisma from cwd
npx prisma migrate dev --name what-you-changed    # writes prisma/migrations/<ts>_<name>/
npm test --workspace apps/web                     # planner + env contract (from anywhere)
```

At container start `scripts/db-bootstrap.mjs` runs `prisma migrate deploy` and
**exits non-zero if it cannot prove the schema is current**, so ECS rolls back
rather than serving against an unknown shape. Prisma holds a Postgres advisory
lock, so several tasks starting at once serialise instead of racing.

The pilot database predates migrations, so it carries a recorded-not-replayed
baseline (`20260730000000_baseline`). Nothing special is needed for it — the
bootstrap detects that state and records the baseline once. See
`docs/decisions/ADR-0001-versioned-migrations-and-boot-safety.md`.

Never run `prisma db push` against the pilot: it is unversioned, and
`--accept-data-loss` will drop columns to reach the target shape.

## Environment

`src/lib/env.ts` is checked at boot (`src/instrumentation.ts`). A misconfigured
environment is a boot failure naming the variable, not a 500 later. In
production it refuses:

| Refused | Why |
|---|---|
| `AUTH_DEV_LOGIN=true` without `ALLOW_DEV_LOGIN_IN_PRODUCTION=true` | passwordless sign-in as any seeded account, including OSE Director |
| Neither dev login nor complete Okta | nobody can sign in |
| `AUTH_SECRET` under 32 chars, or a known placeholder | forgeable sessions |
| Non-https `NEXTAUTH_URL` (except loopback) | session cookie in clear |

`.env.example` documents every variable for local setup.

## The roster is no longer in the repository

`apps/web/scripts/roster-data.mjs` and the OSE spreadsheets it was extracted from
are gitignored. They hold 172 named students and advisors with their university
addresses, and while this repository is public `raw.githubusercontent.com` served
them to anyone — the data was as private as a repository setting.

`scripts/roster-source.mjs` resolves, in order: `ROSTER_FILE`, then
`scripts/roster-data.mjs` if present, then the committed synthetic fixture
`scripts/roster-data.sample.mjs`. So:

- **Local development and CI** fall through to the fixture: same 26 clubs, 209
  seats, codes, vacancies and predecessor links, every address `@example.invalid`.
  Nothing needs configuring.
- **Seeding a real institution** needs the real file:
  ```sh
  ROSTER_FILE=/path/to/roster-data.mjs node scripts/seed.mjs
  ```
  Without it, seeding refuses in production rather than putting invented people
  on real board seats. That refusal is the intended behaviour, not a fault.

Keep the real roster somewhere the repository is not — an operator machine or a
private bucket. Regenerate the fixture after a roster change with
`node scripts/anonymize-roster.mjs > scripts/roster-data.sample.mjs`.

**History still contains the removed files.** Untracking stops `main` serving
them; it does not rewrite past commits, and anyone who cloned already has them.
Making the repository private is the only thing that closes that, and it needs
the data owner's involvement.

## The interim sign-in gate

Until Okta is live, passwordless sign-in sits behind a shared passphrase. It
stays in place for the whole pilot — there is no other sign-in path until SSO
lands, so removing it means nobody can get in.

**Choose it yourself.** Add a repository secret `DEV_LOGIN_PASSPHRASE` (GitHub →
Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions) and deploy. Minimum 12 characters —
Terraform rejects anything shorter at plan time, because `src/lib/env.ts` refuses
to boot below that. Pick something a pilot user can be told over the phone.

Changing it later is the same two steps: update the secret, redeploy. Editing the
value directly in the AWS console does **not** stick; the next apply rewrites it
from the secret.

**If you never set it**, Terraform generates a 24-character one instead. That is
safe but only readable from AWS, which is a bad place to be looking when someone
is waiting to be shown the product:

```sh
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id tenure-pilot/dev-login \
  --query SecretString --output text
```

`terraform output dev_login_passphrase_is_chosen` says which of the two you are
on. Give the passphrase to pilot users. It is enforced server-side in
`src/lib/auth.ts` before the account lookup, so a wrong passphrase cannot even
be used to probe which emails exist, and `src/lib/env.ts` refuses to boot if dev
login is on in production without one.

**Removing it when Okta lands** — one step, in this order:

1. Put `OKTA_ISSUER`, `OKTA_CLIENT_ID`, `OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET` into Secrets
   Manager (`tenure-pilot/app`). Okta registers itself once `OKTA_ISSUER`
   is an `https://` URL (`src/lib/auth.ts`).
2. In `ecs.tf`, set `AUTH_DEV_LOGIN` to `"false"` and delete both
   `ALLOW_DEV_LOGIN_IN_PRODUCTION` and the `DEV_LOGIN_PASSPHRASE` secret entry.
3. **Rotate `AUTH_SECRET`** — Actions → *Rotate Auth Secret*. This step is not
   optional and is easy to miss: turning `AUTH_DEV_LOGIN` off only removes the
   provider, it does **not** invalidate sessions that were already issued
   through it. Sessions are JWTs (`src/lib/auth.ts`, `session: { strategy: "jwt" }`),
   so they are validated by signature alone — nothing is looked up server-side
   that could revoke them. Anyone holding a cookie minted while dev login was on
   stays signed in as whoever they picked, for the life of that token, after the
   door is closed behind them. Rotating the signing secret is what actually
   ends those sessions.
4. Delete `infrastructure/terraform/dev-login-gate.tf` and its ARN from the
   `ecs_secrets` policy in `secrets.tf`.

The gate adds no sign-in path of its own, so removing `AUTH_DEV_LOGIN` removes
the provider it guards and there is nothing left behind. Also delete the seeded
`@tenure.demo` users at that point — they are accounts with no credential.

## Known pilot limitations

- **Passwordless dev sign-in is on in production, behind an interim gate.**
  `AUTH_DEV_LOGIN=true` plus the seeded `@tenure.demo` accounts would otherwise
  mean anyone who can reach the site signs in as OSE Director. A shared
  passphrase now stands in front of it (below). That is a stopgap, not the fix:
  every pilot user holds the same secret, so it does not identify anyone and it
  still blocks real institutional data. Okta closes it properly.
- Reference data is published by the "Seed reference data" workflow, which runs
  `scripts/seed.mjs` once as a one-off ECS task. It is **not** run at container
  start: `SEED_ON_BOOT` is deliberately unset in `ecs.tf`, because the script is
  an e2e fixture that issues unscoped deletes. Migrations still run at boot; a
  backfill longer than the ALB health-check grace period will need its own
  `RunTask` stage.
- Single ECS task (no HA); scale `ecs_desired_count` for production.
- Free-tier account caps RDS backups at 1 day — raise to 7 after upgrading.
- **No rate limiting, and the edge gate that compensated for it is now off.**
  This was written when unknown viewers could not reach the app at all. Since
  2026-07-31 they can, so nothing stands between the internet and the sign-in
  form except the passphrase, and nothing throttles attempts against it. The
  passphrase itself is not guessable (~124 bits), so the exposure is not brute
  force — it is that anything expensive and authenticated has no per-user quota.
  AI synthesis is the sharp one: it calls a paid API per question, so a single
  tester with the passphrase can spend real money in a loop. Attach
  `aws_wafv2_web_acl` with rate-based rules, or add per-user throttling in the
  application, before the pilot widens.
- The app runs as the RDS master user (`entrypoint.sh` composes `DATABASE_URL`
  from the AWS-managed master secret), so a server-side compromise gets
  database-owner rights rather than the CRUD its queries need.

## The closed-pilot access gate — currently OFF

**As of 2026-07-31 the edge gate is disabled** (`edge_gate_enabled = false`), by
decision, until AWS Cognito SSO is rolled out. The sign-in passphrase is the
only control in front of the pilot. Everything below describes the gate as it
works when switched back on, which is a one-line change and an apply — the
CloudFront Function stays built and published, just attached to nothing.

Why it was turned off: it required every pilot user to be handed a one-time link
before they could see a login form, and the thing behind it is a single shared
passphrase either way. Someone holding the passphrase was given it deliberately;
someone without it gets no further from inside CloudFront than outside.

What that costs, stated plainly:

- **A leaked passphrase is now the whole story.** Guessing it is not a risk — 24
  characters over a 36-symbol alphabet is about 124 bits — but it travels by
  email and chat, it is the same secret for everyone, and it identifies nobody.
  Whoever ends up with it has a one-click `OSE_DIRECTOR` account.
- **Nothing rate-limits the sign-in form**, which mattered less when strangers
  could not reach it. See the rate-limiting entry above.
- The sign-in page is publicly reachable, so `next.config.ts` sends
  `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`.

When it is on, this exists because one control in front of a real 172-person
directory and a one-click `OSE_DIRECTOR` account is not much: two independent
things then have to be wrong before a stranger sees institutional data.

**Getting in.** Terraform prints a one-time entry link:

```sh
cd infrastructure/terraform && terraform output -raw edge_access_url
```

Opening it sets a 30-day `HttpOnly` cookie on that browser and redirects to the
page with the token stripped from the URL. That link plus the sign-in passphrase
is what a pilot tester needs. The operator's own addresses are also allowlisted
in `var.edge_allowed_ips`, so a normal working session needs neither — but the
link is the recovery path when an ISP renumbers, a phone is on cellular, or
CloudFront serves the same laptop over IPv6.

**Adding someone's network.** Append to `edge_allowed_ips` in `edge-access.tf`
and deploy. Prefer handing out the link; an address list goes stale silently.

**Two paths stay open, deliberately** — `/api/health`, which `deploy.yml` curls
from a GitHub Actions runner whose address cannot be allowlisted, and
`/api/jobs/reminders`, which EventBridge POSTs daily and which already requires
`JOB_SECRET`. Both are exact-match, so no path walks out of the exemption.

**The origin is closed too.** The ALB security group accepts port 80 only from
the `com.amazonaws.global.cloudfront.origin-facing` managed prefix list. It was
previously open to `0.0.0.0/0` under a comment claiming otherwise, which meant
the ALB's DNS name served the whole application in clear text and would have
walked straight around this gate.

**Removing it** when Okta is live and real people can authenticate: delete
`edge-access.tf` and the three `function_association` blocks in `cloudfront.tf`.
Leave the security-group rule alone — the origin should stay closed permanently.
